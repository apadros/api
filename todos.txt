Array
	- A structure to encapsulate both static and dynamic arrays into a single type
		- Initializer overloads
		- Supporting generic functions
		- ForArray()
		
Logging
  - Stack trace printing
	
Memory
	- Allow client code to set a global maximum for memory allocation
		(i.e. I don't want my program to allocate more than X globally)
		
Misc
	- Any code marked as @EXPORT_API in calendar project
	- Batch file to package files for GitHub release
		- Headers, libs and dlls
		
String
	- Rounding within F32ToString()
	- Option for user to manually free dynamic strings as they wish
		- Won't make any impact on performance until string memory implementation switched to a pool allocator
	- If generic array struct an functionality implement, inherit from it? See Arrat section above.
		
		
Time
	 - Creation of a date struct from a string
	 - Days of the week into date struct
	 - Consideration of work days in all relevant functionality
		
Win32
	- More in-depth logging in case of error detection / failure
