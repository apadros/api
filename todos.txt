Array
	- A structure to encapsulate both static and dynamic arrays into a single type
		- Initializer overloads
		- Supporting generic functions
		- ForArray()
		
Debug / Error
	- Currently assertions are printed in command line programs by default, need an equivalent for GUI programs @CURRENT
		- Message box with assertions failure
		- Need a way to differentiate between command line and GUI programs - flag set by GUI init function

File
	- @BUG - Function pointers are Null when calling from the dll
	
GUI
	- Basic window creation init code @PRIORITY
		
Logging
	- A function to return a pointer to the log contents, cast to const char* (e.g. to print)
  - Stack trace printing
	
Memory
	- Allow client code to set a global maximum for memory allocation
		(i.e. I don't want my program to allocate more than X globally)
	- PopStack() - have it clear all popped memory to 0 - requested memory should always be 0
		
Misc
		
String
	- Rounding within F32ToString()
	- Option for user to manually free dynamic strings as they wish
		- Won't make any impact on performance until string memory implementation switched to a pool allocator
	- If generic array struct and functionality implemented, inherit from it? See Array section above.	
		
Time
		
Win32
	- More in-depth logging in case of error detection / failure
