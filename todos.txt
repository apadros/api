Array
	- A structure to encapsulate both static and dynamic arrays into a single type
		- Initializer overloads
		- Supporting generic functions
		- ForArray()
		
Debug / Error
	- InvalidCodePath macro
	
File
	- @BUG - Functions don't seem to point to their Win32 counterparts
		
Logging
  - Stack trace printing
	
Memory
	- @BUG - Recursive call of PushMemory() has initial stack memory copied into incorrect place
		- Work out final capacity needed (previous x 2 recursively) and allocate once instead of using copying memory recursively
	- Allow client code to set a global maximum for memory allocation
		(i.e. I don't want my program to allocate more than X globally)
	- ResetStack() - have it clear all used memory to 0 - requested memory should always be 0
	- PopStack() - have it clear all popped memory to 0 - requested memory should always be 0
		
Misc
	- Any code marked as @EXPORT_API in calendar project
		
String
	- Operator != ?
	- Operator + (integer) - return chars + integer
	- Rounding within F32ToString()
	- Option for user to manually free dynamic strings as they wish
		- Won't make any impact on performance until string memory implementation switched to a pool allocator
	- If generic array struct an functionality implemented, inherit from it? See Array section above.
		
		
Time
	- IsDate(string) function to return true for formats dd/mm, dd/mm/yy and dd/mm/yyyy
	- Add "dd/mm/yyyy" as standard date format
	- Creation of a date struct from a string
	- Days of the week into date struct
	- Consideration of work days in all relevant functionality
		
Win32
	- More in-depth logging in case of error detection / failure
