Array
	- A structure to encapsulate both static and dynamic arrays into a single type
		- Initializer overloads
		- Supporting generic functions
		- ForArray()
		- Templated?
		
Bitmaps / Images
	- Integration of png support via external library 
		- linpng? - https://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
			- Include copyright / licensing info in LICENSE.txt
		
Debug / Error
	- Replace DisplayErrorGUI() with a function pointer once @LINKING_BUG has been fixed

File
	- @BUG - Function pointers are Null when calling from the dll @LINKING_BUG
	
GUI
	- Custom window icon
	- Custom taskbar icon
		
Logging
	- A function to return a pointer to the log contents, cast to const char* (e.g. to print)
  - Stack trace printing
	
Memory
	- When Push() allocates a new stack, any pointers to old memory are automatically invalid and there is currently no way to directly tell the user this has happened. Fix.
	- Allow client code to set a global maximum for memory allocation
		(i.e. I don't want my program to allocate more than X globally)
	- PopStack() - have it clear all popped memory to 0 - requested memory should always be 0
		
Misc
	- Various @TODO in code files
	
OpenGL / Rendering
	- GL-specific assertions / error logging (glGetError())
	- Rendering of a sample pixel buffer
		- Immediate mode / fixed-function rendering
		
String
	- Currently operator= copies the pointer to the text data into the target variable, not evident without delving into cpp file. 
		This has lead to a bug in DateToString() where DateFormateLong is being overwritten.
		- Debugging this took time from a separate project and would have been impossible with only dlls, had to temporarily import cpp directly.
			Conclusion is that encapsulation in string API has obfuscated too much for easy-of-use and the same could be happening / could happen in the future in other parts of the API.
			- Resort to more DoD approach, make data transformation more obvious and remove as much hidden state as possible while balancing ease-of-use. @CURRENT
	- Rounding within F32ToString()
	- Option for user to manually free dynamic strings as they wish
		- Won't make any impact on performance until string memory implementation switched to a pool allocator
	- If generic array struct and functionality implemented, inherit from it? See Array section above.	
	
Text
	- Investigate ttf file loading and usage through Windows API
		
Time
	- Conversions between formats
	- Replace GetTimeMarker() with a function pointer once @LINKING_BUG has been fixed
	
Win32
	- More in-depth logging in case of error detection / failure
